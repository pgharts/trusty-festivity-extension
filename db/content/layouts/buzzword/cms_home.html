        <p class="headline-2"><span style="font-size: 1.5em;">Buzzword Pittsburgh</span> was created to excite children and families as they discover the words that are all around them. Through talk and play about math, science, and art, families will expand their young children&rsquo;s vocabulary and conversation skills. The program will engage families and community organizations in Pittsburgh&rsquo;s Homewood neighborhood and the greater community.
            <br/><br/>
            The Buzzword Pittsburgh collaborative consists of six partner organizations with expertise in the arts and sciences. They will provide interactive learning opportunities that will encourage imagination, investigation, creation, and reflection. This initiative is supported by PNC Grow Up Great.</p>
